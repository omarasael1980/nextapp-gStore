 # GuitarLA, it's a webpage that belong to  a React course.

It has been built in NextJs, it consums a Strapi API [(see the project in my repository](https://github.com/omarasael1980/guitarrStore)), it has an index,  posts, guitar store and a  store cart.

The index has general information, while in Store "Tienda" you can select any item and will open with the full information so you can select how many guitars you want to buy, when you click the button it will be save in the local storage and in the store cart

# Welcome to NextJS!

- [NextJS Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`

### Using a Template

When you ran `npx create-remix@latest` there were a few choices for hosting. You can run that again to create a new project, then copy over your `app/` folder to the new project that's pre-configured for your target server.

```sh
cd ..
# create a new project, and pick a pre-configured host
npx create-remix@latest
cd my-new-remix-app
# remove the new project's app (not the old one!)
rm -rf app
# copy your app over
cp -R ../my-old-remix-app/app app
```
